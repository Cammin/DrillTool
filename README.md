# Drill Tool

This mod adds one new tool that can harvest large resource deposits.

The blueprint unlocks at the same time as the Prawn drill arm.

## Premise
The basic functionality for my Subnautica rock-breaking tool is complete. I'm happy with how it works and accomplishes its purpose.  I want to have VFX, SFX, custom model and custom arm+tool animations.

My goal was to make a tool that can mine large resources as an addition to the Prawn drill arm.
I always felt like there ought to be an alternate way to mine from these because there are so many large resources scattered around the map, and restricting to only prawn suit usage feels like there's an opportunity to put something new in that place, especially because there's so much of those resources everywhere.

A goal was to make it feel faithful, like if the original devs had developed it themselves.
