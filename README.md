# Drill Tool
This Subnautica mod adds a new tool that can harvest large resource deposits.  
It can also drill & bash outcrops, and hit creatures.

### Details
- The tool's blueprint unlocks at the same time as the Prawn drill arm.
- It is crafted with:
  - 4 Diamonds
  - 1 Advanced wiring kit
  - 1 Titanium 

### Configurable Values
- Drill speed: By default, it mines drillables as quickly as the Prawn drill arm.
- Battery consumption rate: By default, one battery is enough for two deposits.

### New Console Command
`RestoreDrillable` Reverts the nearest drillable to its full state.

# Install
- (Requires Nautilus)

## Future Ideas
- IK for aiming the tool to the spot on the drillable that is currently being mined
- Custom UI icon
- Unique scannable fragments
- First-use animation
- PDA voice describing it upon first craft

## Stretch Goals
- More highly customized arm animations
- Custom Model
- Custom SFX
- Custom VFX

## Premise
My goal was to make a tool that can mine large resources as an addition to the Prawn drill arm.  

I always felt like there ought to be an alternate way to mine from these because there are so many large resources scattered around the map, and restricting to only prawn suit usage feels like there's an opportunity to put something new in that place, especially because there's so much of those resources everywhere.  

Another goal was to make it feel faithful, as if the original developers had made it themselves.

It might seem powerful as a handheld tool, but it is balanced out because it consumes lots of battery energy.
